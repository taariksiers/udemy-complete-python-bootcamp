# Random Lecture Notes

## Section 3 - Lecture 14 

- Strings are ordered sequences.
- This means you can use indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string.

## Section 3 - Lecture 18
- Stick/inject a variable into a string - string interpolation
- f-strings - formatted string literals

## Section 3 - Lecture 20

### Lists
- **Lists** are **ordered** sequences that can hold a *variety* of **object types**
- They use [] brackets and commas to separate objects, e.g. `[1,2,3,4,'a']`
- Lists support indexing and slicing i.e. retrieve based on location
- They can be nested and also have a variety of methods that can be called off them
- Can mutate values, add values (append), or remove (pop), reverse, sort

## Section 3 - Lecture 22

### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are **unordered** mappings for storing objects. They cannot be sorted.
- Dictionaries use key-value pairing `{'key1':'value1', 'key2','value2'}`
- Useful because you can grab based on key
- Can hold different data types and even dictionaries
- Keys should always be strings

## Section 3 - Lecture 24

### Tuples
- Very similar to lists, however, one key difference - **immutability**
- Once an element is inside a tuple, it cannot be reassigned
- Tuples use parenthesis: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Supports indexing, slicing

## Section 3 - Lecture 25

### Sets
- Sets are **unordered** collections of **unique** elements
- There can only be 1 representative of the same object `my_set = set(1,3,4)`

## Section 3 - Lecture 26

### Booleans
- **False** and **True** (case is important)
- You can also use the **None** placeholder when declaring a variable `b = None`

## Section 3 - Lecture 27

### I/O with Files
